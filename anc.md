# Cross-Region Recovery of EBS Volume from Snapshot (Primary Region: Ireland, Recovery Region: London)

In the event of a primary AWS region (Ireland) outage, you may need to recover an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume from a snapshot in a different region (London) to ensure data availability and business continuity.
## Prerequisites

1. **AWS Console Access**: You need access to the AWS Management Console with appropriate permissions to perform recovery actions on EBS volumes and snapshots.

2. **EBS Snapshot**: A recent snapshot of the EBS volume from the Ireland region must be available in the London region. If you do not have a recent cross-region snapshot, it's recommended to establish automated cross-region snapshot replication for future recovery scenarios.

3. **EC2 Instances**: Ensure that you have EC2 instances set up in the London region where you can attach the recovered EBS volume.

## Recovery Steps

### 1. Log in to AWS Management Console

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

2. Log in using your AWS credentials.

### 2. Access EC2 Dashboard

1. From the AWS Management Console, navigate to the "EC2" service by either selecting it from the services menu or searching for "EC2" in the search bar.

### 3. Navigate to Snapshots

1. In the EC2 Dashboard, click on "Snapshots" in the left navigation pane under the "Elastic Block Store" section.

### 4. Identify Cross-Region Snapshot

1. Locate and select the appropriate cross-region snapshot from the list. This should be a snapshot of the EBS volume from the Ireland region.

### 5. Restore Snapshot to EBS Volume

1. With the snapshot selected, click on the "Actions" dropdown menu.

2. From the dropdown menu, choose "Create Volume."

3. In the "Create Volume" dialog:
   - **Availability Zone**: Choose an availability zone in the London region where you want to create the recovered EBS volume.
   - **Volume Type and Size**: Choose the volume type and specify the desired size for the recovered volume.
   - **Encrypted**: Choose whether to create an encrypted volume or not.
   - Review and modify other settings as necessary.

4. Click the "Create" button to initiate the creation of the EBS volume from the selected cross-region snapshot.

### 6. Attach Volume to EC2 Instance

1. Once the volume is successfully created, navigate to the "Volumes" section in the EC2 Dashboard.

2. Locate the newly created volume and select it.

3. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and choose "Attach Volume."

4. In the "Attach Volume" dialog:
   - **Instance**: Choose the EC2 instance in the London region to which you want to attach the recovered EBS volume.
   - **Device**: Specify the device name (e.g., /dev/sdf) to attach the volume.
   - Click the "Attach" button to attach the volume to the instance.

### 7. Mount and Verify Data

1. Log in to the EC2 instance where you attached the recovered EBS volume.

2. Use the appropriate commands to mount the attached volume to a mount point on the instance (e.g., `mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/myrecovereddata`).

3. Verify that the data on the recovered volume is intact and accessible.

### 8. Update Applications (if needed)

1. If the recovered EBS volume contains data used by applications, update the application configuration or scripts to point to the correct mount point on the instance.

### 9. Cleanup (Optional)

1. If necessary, delete any old or unused EBS volumes and snapshots to free up resources.
